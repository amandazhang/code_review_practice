code reviewing for homework 2 (reshape, get_increment, mean)

#for reshape part:
I consider Yunchan's solution the most breif one, which calls funcion
size and check whether it's a sufficient reshape.

#for get_increment function:
I don't think if else statement in Jay's solution is a necessary. 
Other's work are all brief solution.


#for mean function:
zeyu use asum function defined before to get the sum of the data, and then 
process on its result, which I think is the most effective. However Yunchuan
did some unneseeary steps to get output shape, which could simply be done by
using asum.
